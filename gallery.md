# Gallery

These images are versioned visual baselines, not golden-reference renders. They
exist so that an intentional improvement and an unintentional regression are
both visible in a diff.

**Status: no baselines yet.** The renderer is under construction; see
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Phase 8 is the phase that fills this table.
The scenes, cameras, and settings below are fixed now so that every later
measurement is comparable, and so the gate that protects them exists before
there is anything to protect.

## Contract

Baselines are 1024 pixels wide at 1024 samples per pixel, rendered in 32
progressive updates, four spectral lanes, with subdivision and MaterialX
displacement enabled at the deterministic level-2 gallery setting. The New
Zealand height map is the deliberate exception: its single authored quad is
uniformly refined at level 6 before displacement.

The renderer's output is always scene-linear. `render_gallery.bat` records
temporary EXRs under `build/gallery-linear`, then writes the display JPEGs
through a neutral HDR highlight compressor and the standard sRGB transfer
function. `HDCLAUDE_GALLERY_EXPOSURE` sets display exposure in stops; the
versioned baselines use the default of zero.

**Every render is compared against its committed baseline before that baseline
is replaced.** RMS, per-pixel maximum, and failed-pixel count all have
thresholds, and a render that fails any of them stops the script. Exit status
alone is not a gate: hdCodex gated on exit status, and a run that lost the
Vulkan device wrote a black image and exited 0, which was accepted. See
[docs/lessons-from-hdcodex.md](docs/lessons-from-hdcodex.md) R9. Use
`render_gallery.bat -Accept` to deliberately adopt a changed image.

Whenever a baseline is regenerated, refresh its wall time, SHA-256, and machine
record in this file using the exact command shown for that scene. The hashes
identify the committed display JPEGs. Do not infer timings from file timestamps
or from partial diagnostic renders. Timings include renderer startup, scene
loading, MaterialX generation and compilation, geometry processing, and
sampling; display-JPEG conversion is excluded.

### Machine record

Recorded with every measurement, because a timing without it cannot be compared
and a device-loss investigation cannot start without it. hdCodex spent days on a
"TDR timeout" hypothesis that this one row falsifies
([lessons](docs/lessons-from-hdcodex.md) R11).

## External assets

The gallery stages are thin layers that reference assets living outside this
repository, so the repository stays small and carries no redistributed content.
Each scene below names its source. Paths are absolute in the committed `.usda`
files, matching the development workstation; adjust the `subLayers` path to
relocate an asset.

### Intel Sponza

**Source:** [Intel Graphics Research Samples](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/graphics-research/samples.html)

A large textured architectural scene. Its bound materials are USD-native
`UsdPreviewSurface` networks, so this baseline exercises how hdClaude handles a
stage whose materials are not MaterialX.

```cmd
set "HDCLAUDE_SAMPLES_PER_PIXEL=1024"
set "HDCLAUDE_SAMPLES_PER_UPDATE=32"
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera PhysCamera001 gallery\intel_sponza.usda build\gallery-linear\intel_sponza.exr
```

### OpenChessSet

**Source:** [usd-wg/assets OpenChessSet](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets/tree/main/full_assets/OpenChessSet)

Instancing, HDR dome lighting, and many distinct materials. This is the scene
that most directly measures whether per-material dispatch scales.

```cmd
set "HDCLAUDE_SAMPLES_PER_PIXEL=1024"
set "HDCLAUDE_SAMPLES_PER_UPDATE=32"
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera renderCam gallery\chess_board.usda build\gallery-linear\chess_board.exr
```

### StandardShaderBall Gold

**Source:** [usd-wg/assets StandardShaderBall](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets/tree/main/full_assets/StandardShaderBall)

Artistic-metalness conductor response.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera camera gallery\shader_ball_gold.usda build\gallery-linear\shader_ball_gold.exr
```

### StandardShaderBall Glass

**Source:** [usd-wg/assets StandardShaderBall](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets/tree/main/full_assets/StandardShaderBall)

Spectral dielectric transmission, dispersion, and total internal reflection.
The scene where four hero wavelengths earn their cost.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera camera gallery\shader_ball_glass.usda build\gallery-linear\shader_ball_glass.exr
```

### StandardShaderBall BubbleGum

**Source:** [usd-wg/assets StandardShaderBall](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets/tree/main/full_assets/StandardShaderBall)

Subsurface transport and image textures.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera camera gallery\shader_ball_bubblegum.usda build\gallery-linear\shader_ball_bubblegum.exr
```

### Pixar's KitchenSet

**Source:** [OpenUSD Kitchen Set](https://openusd.org/release/dl_kitchen_set.html)

Authored Z-up coordinates, deep instancing, and unbound meshes that fall back to
`displayColor`. Also the subdivision performance reference.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera renderCam gallery\pixar_kitchen.usda build\gallery-linear\pixar_kitchen.exr
```

### Collective Project 001

**Source:** [usd-wg/collectiveproject001](https://github.com/usd-wg/collectiveproject001/blob/main/shots/s001_001/index.usda)

UsdSkel deformation through Hydra `extComputation`, and per-face material
subsets. The scene that exercises in-place BLAS update under deformation.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --purposes render --camera mono gallery\collectiveproject001.usda build\gallery-linear\collectiveproject001.exr
```

### OpenPBR Playground

**Source:** [OpenPBRShaderPlayground](https://github.com/DigitalProductionExampleLibrary/OpenPBRShaderPlayground/blob/main/ShdrPlygrnd/ShdrPlygrnd_OpenPBR.usda)

The MaterialX/OpenPBR reference. This is the scene hdClaude's whole shading
commitment is aimed at: every material here must compile and execute through
the `genglsl_pt` target with no approximation and no fallback
([docs/materialx-codegen.md](docs/materialx-codegen.md) 8).

It is also the scene on which hdCodex reproducibly lost the Vulkan device.
Recorded here so the first hdClaude run of it is treated as evidence.

```cmd
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --purposes render --camera renderCam_mainCU gallery\openpbr_playground.usda build\gallery-linear\openpbr_playground.exr
```

### Subdivision Feature Matrix

A renderer-owned scene isolating six subdivision paths: an indexed face-varying
UV seam, a Catmull-Clark cube with edge creases and a sharp corner, a Loop
tetrahedron, a Catmull-Clark grid with a holed coarse face, two coarse-face
material subsets, and MaterialX displacement on a bilinear patch.

```cmd
set "HDCLAUDE_ENABLE_SUBDIVISION=1"
set "HDCLAUDE_SUBDIVISION_LEVEL=2"
set "HDCLAUDE_ENABLE_DISPLACEMENT=1"
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera camera gallery\subdivision_features.usda build\gallery-linear\subdivision_features.exr
```

### New Zealand Height Map

One authored bilinear quad displaced by a MaterialX `ND_image_float` height map
after uniform level-6 refinement. The same map drives surface colour, so texture
resolution and UV orientation are visible independently of the displaced
silhouette. The texture is committed under `gallery/textures/`.

```cmd
set "HDCLAUDE_ENABLE_SUBDIVISION=1"
set "HDCLAUDE_SUBDIVISION_LEVEL=6"
set "HDCLAUDE_ENABLE_DISPLACEMENT=1"
render_claude.bat --imageWidth 1024 --colorCorrectionMode disabled --camera camera gallery\newzealand_heightmap.usda build\gallery-linear\newzealand_heightmap.exr
```
